# Pocket Weather!

The Pocket Weather website when given a location will get the current weather observations as well as a forecast for the next 5 Days! This is a global app with 0 fuss. 

The motivation behind this project was to use third-party APIs to process and then display the information that I recieve from them on my webpage by dynamically creating HTML that consists of the data derived from the API. This allows for up to date information to be displayed whenenver the website is called upon.

This project allowed me to continue to build my knowledgeo of working with third-party APIs, and using the data recieved from them
